1. Customer Segmentation (purchase_behaviour.csv)
*Customers are classified by life-stage â€“ young singles, families, retirees, and whether they belong to the premium customer group or not.
*The most profitable customer group is premium families, with high frequent and high-value purchasing.
*Young singles and retirees are less profitable since they purchase with lower frequencies, or they purchase at lower prices.
This enables the company to communicate premium family customers with specific offers and discounts for increasing profitability.

2. Transaction Data (transaction_data.csv)
The highest revenue is generated by the top 3 products as the most profitable. These could be highly priced products or recurrently purchased products.
*The most faithful customers are those with the highest number of transactions over time.
*Customers most likely want constant quality, ease of use, and reward schemes.
More individualized discount schemes or membership services could make loyalty even stronger.

Key Takeaway for the Marketing Team:
Prioritize premium families as they represent the highest valued customers.
Advertise those items that are doing well in an effort to build revenue
Offer discounts or sneak previews to loyal customers.
